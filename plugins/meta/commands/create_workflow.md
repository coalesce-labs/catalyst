# Create Workflow

You are tasked with helping users create new agents or commands by leveraging discovered patterns,
templates, and examples from the workflow catalog.

## Purpose

This command guides users through creating well-structured, standardized workflows by showing
relevant examples and enforcing frontmatter consistency.

## Initial Response

When invoked:

```
I'll help you create a new agent or command.

What would you like to create?
1. Agent (for Task tool sub-agents)
2. Command (for slash commands)

Or provide details:
- Name: (e.g., code-reviewer, test-generator)
- Purpose: (brief description)
- Similar to: (optional - name of existing workflow to model after)
```

## Process

### Step 1: Gather Requirements

Ask the user:

1. **Type**: Agent or Command?
2. **Name**: What should it be called? (suggest kebab-case)
3. **Purpose**: What does it do?
4. **Tools needed**: Which Claude Code tools will it use?
5. **Category**: Which category does it belong to?
6. **Similar workflows**: Any existing workflows to model after?

### Step 2: Parallel Example Research

**IMPORTANT**: Spawn 3 parallel tasks to gather comprehensive examples.

Use TodoWrite to track parallel research.

**Task 1 - Local Examples**:

```
Use codebase-pattern-finder agent:
"Find all {agents/commands} in our workspace that are similar to {user-description}. Focus on {category} workflows. Return file paths and brief descriptions."

Tools: Glob, Grep, Read
Path: /Users/ryan/code-repos/ryan-claude-workspace
Return: List of similar local workflows with their frontmatter and key patterns
```

**Task 2 - Catalog Examples**:

```
Use thoughts-analyzer agent:
"Search the workflow catalog at thoughts/shared/workflows/ for workflows similar to {user-description}. Find examples from external repositories that match the {category} category."

Tools: Grep, Read
Path: thoughts/shared/workflows/
Return: External workflow examples with their implementations
```

**Task 3 - Frontmatter Standards**:

```
Use codebase-analyzer agent:
"Analyze all existing {agents/commands} in the workspace to extract the frontmatter standard. What fields are required? What patterns are used? What categories exist?"

Tools: Glob, Grep, Read
Path: /Users/ryan/code-repos/ryan-claude-workspace/{agents,commands}/
Return: Frontmatter standard with field definitions and examples
```

**WAIT for all 3 tasks to complete.**

### Step 3: Aggregate Examples

Combine results from parallel tasks:

- Local examples (Task 1)
- Catalog examples (Task 2)
- Frontmatter standards (Task 3)

Mark all tasks complete in TodoWrite.

Analyze:

1. **Common patterns**: What do similar workflows do?
2. **Tool usage**: Which tools are typically used?
3. **Structure**: How are they organized?
4. **Frontmatter**: What's the standard format?

### Step 4: Present Options to User

Show analysis and options:

````markdown
# Create {workflow-type}: {name}

## Similar Workflows Found

### From Our Workspace

1. **{local-workflow-1}**
   - Purpose: {description}
   - Tools: {tools}
   - File: {path}

2. **{local-workflow-2}** [....]

### From Catalog

1. **{external-workflow-1}** (from {repo})
   - Purpose: {description}
   - Tools: {tools}

## Frontmatter Standard

Based on existing workflows, here's the standard format:

```yaml
---
{ required-fields }
---
```
````

## Recommended Approach

Based on similar workflows, I recommend:

- **Model after**: {most-similar-workflow}
- **Tools to use**: {suggested-tools}
- **Key patterns**: {patterns-to-follow}

Would you like me to:

1. Generate a workflow based on {specific-example}
2. Create a custom workflow from scratch
3. Show me more examples first

````

### Step 5: Generate Workflow Template

Based on user selection, generate the appropriate template:

#### 5a. For Agents

```markdown
---
name: {workflow-name}
description: |
  {Clear description from user input}

  Use this agent when:
  - {use case 1}
  - {use case 2}

  This agent will:
  - {action 1}
  - {action 2}
tools: {validated-tool-list}
model: inherit
category: {selected-category}
version: 1.0.0
---

# {Agent Name}

### Step 6: Validate Template

Before showing to user, validate:

1. **Frontmatter**:
   - All required fields present?
   - Tools list valid?
   - Category matches existing categories?
   - Name in kebab-case?
   - Version starts at 1.0.0?

2. **Structure**:
   - Clear purpose statement?
   - Step-by-step process?
   - Output format specified (for agents)?
   - Error handling included?

3. **Consistency**:
   - Matches patterns from similar workflows?
   - Uses workspace conventions?
   - References config.json for project-specific values?

If validation fails, fix issues before proceeding.

### Step 7: Present Draft

Show the user the generated template:

```markdown
# Generated Workflow: {name}

I've created a draft based on {source-pattern}.

**Type**: {Agent/Command}
**File**: {target-path}

## Frontmatter
```yaml
{frontmatter}
````

## Key Features

- {Feature 1}
- {Feature 2}
- {Feature 3}

## Modeled After

- Local: {local-example if any}
- External: {catalog-example if any}

Would you like me to:

1. Save this workflow as-is
2. Make adjustments (specify what to change)
3. Show me alternative approaches

````

### Step 8: Iterate on Feedback

Be ready to adjust:
- Add/remove steps
- Change tools
- Adjust frontmatter
- Modify structure
- Add examples
- Update descriptions

Continue iterating until user is satisfied.

### Step 9: Save Workflow

Determine save location:

**If Agent**:
- Save to: `agents/{workflow-name}.md`

**If Command**:
- Save to: `commands/{workflow-name}.md`

### Step 10: Create Creation Record

Save creation details to `thoughts/shared/workflows/created.md`:

```markdown
## {workflow-name}

- **Created**: {date}
- **Type**: {agent/command}
- **Location**: {file-path}
- **Modeled After**:
  - {local-example if any}
  - {catalog-example if any}
- **Purpose**: {brief-description}
- **Tools**: {tool-list}
- **Category**: {category}

**Creation Notes**: {any special notes about decisions made}
````

### Step 11: Confirmation

Present success summary:

```markdown
âœ… Workflow created successfully!

**Saved to**: {file-path}

**What's included**:

- Standardized frontmatter
- Clear step-by-step process
- {Type-specific features}
- Error handling guidelines

**Next steps**:

1. Review: `{file-path}`
2. Test: Try using the workflow
3. Customize: Adjust for your specific needs
4. Commit: `git add {file-path} && git commit -m "Add {workflow-name} {type}"`

Creation recorded in: thoughts/shared/workflows/created.md
```

## Advanced Usage

### Create from Catalog Entry

```
/create-workflow from catalog wshobson/commands/code-review
```
