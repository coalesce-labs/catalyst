# Catalyst PM Plugin

Linear-focused project management plugin with cycle management, backlog grooming, GitHub-Linear correlation, and team analytics.

## Overview

The Catalyst PM plugin provides AI-powered project management workflows that integrate Linear issue tracking with GitHub pull requests. It focuses on actionable insights rather than raw data dumps.

**Philosophy**: Every report includes specific recommendations, not just metrics. PMs should know exactly what action to take after reading any report.

## Features

### Cycle Management
- **Health Scoring**: Progress vs time, blocker impact, at-risk issue detection
- **Capacity Analysis**: Team workload distribution and availability
- **Risk Identification**: Blocked issues, stalled work, scope creep
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Prioritized next steps

### Backlog Health
- **Orphan Detection**: Issues without project assignments
- **Project Classification**: AI-powered project recommendations
- **Staleness Tracking**: Issues inactive >30 days
- **Duplicate Detection**: Similar issue identification

### GitHub-Linear Sync
- **PR Correlation**: Match PRs to Linear issues via branch names, descriptions, attachments
- **Gap Identification**: Orphaned PRs, orphaned issues
- **Merge Automation**: Auto-close candidates with generated commands
- **Stale PR Detection**: PRs open >14 days

### Daily Standups
- **Yesterday's Deliveries**: Completed issues and merged PRs
- **Current Work**: Team member assignments and progress
- **Availability**: Who needs work assigned
- **Quick Blockers**: Immediate attention items

## Commands

### Cycle Management
- `/pm:analyze-cycle` - Analyze cycle health with actionable insights
  - Health assessment (🟢/🟡/🔴)
  - Risk identification (blockers, at-risk issues)
  - Team capacity analysis
  - Specific recommendations

### Milestone Management
- `/pm:analyze-milestone` - Analyze milestone health toward target date
  - Target date feasibility assessment
  - Progress tracking (actual vs expected)
  - Risk identification (behind schedule, blockers)
  - Specific recommendations (adjust timeline, reduce scope)

### `/pm:analyze-cycle`
Generate comprehensive cycle health report with recommendations.

**What it does**:
- Spawns linear-research agent to fetch active cycle data (Haiku)
- Spawns cycle-analyzer agent for health assessment (Sonnet)
- Generates progress metrics, risk factors, capacity analysis
- Provides specific, prioritized recommendations

**Output**: Health report saved to `thoughts/shared/reports/cycles/`

**Example**:
```
🟡 Cycle Health: Sprint 2025-W04 - At Risk

Takeaway: Cycle is 45% complete with 3 days remaining. We're tracking
slightly behind (projected 63% completion). Main risks: 2 blocked issues
and Dave has no assigned work.

Priority Actions:
  1. Escalate TEAM-461 blocker (external dependency, 6 days)
  2. Pair Bob with senior dev on TEAM-462 (dependency conflict)
  3. Assign 2 backlog issues to Dave (no active work)
```

### Daily Operations

## Prerequisites

### Required Tools

1. **Linearis CLI** (with PR #4 cycle features)
   ```bash
   npm install -g --install-links czottmann/linearis
   ```
   See: https://github.com/czottmann/linearis/pull/4

2. **jq** (JSON parsing)
   ```bash
   brew install jq  # macOS
   apt install jq   # Ubuntu/Debian
   ```

3. **GitHub CLI** (optional, for PR sync)
   ```bash
   brew install gh  # macOS
   ```
   See: https://cli.github.com

### Configuration

PM commands read from two config sources:

**1. Project metadata** (`.claude/config.json` - safe to commit):
```json
{
  "catalyst": {
    "projectKey": "acme",
    "project": {
      "ticketPrefix": "ACME"
    }
  }
}
```

**2. Secrets** (`~/.config/catalyst/config-acme.json` - NEVER committed):
```json
{
  "linear": {
    "apiToken": "lin_api_...",
    "teamKey": "ACME"
  }
}
```

**Setup**: Run `./scripts/setup-catalyst-config.sh` to configure your project

- Review capacity
- Address blockers
- Plan capacity adjustments

**Mid-Week**:
```bash
/pm:pr-sync
```
- Check GitHub-Linear correlation
- Close merged issues
- Create missing Linear issues

**End of Week**:
```bash
/pm:backlog-groom
```
- Clean up orphaned issues
- Categorize new issues
- Remove stale issues
- Prepare next cycle

## Configuration Options

Default settings in `.claude/config.json`:

```json
{
  "pm": {
    "defaultCycleView": "active",
    "cycleProgressThreshold": 80,
    "staleIssueDays": 30,
    "atRiskIssueDays": 5,
    "teamAnalyticsEnabled": true,
    "backlogGrooming": {
      "autoDetectProjects": true,
      "duplicateSimilarityThreshold": 0.85,
      "requireEstimates": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Linearis CLI not found"

Install linearis:
```bash
npm install -g --install-links czottmann/linearis
```

Verify installation:
```bash
linearis --version
```

### "LINEAR_API_TOKEN not set"

Export your Linear API token:
```bash
export LINEAR_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

Get token from: https://linear.app/settings/api

### "Configuration file not found"

Ensure `.claude/config.json` exists:
```bash
cat .claude/config.json
```

Create if missing:
```bash
mkdir -p .claude
echo '{"linear": {"teamKey": "TEAM"}}' > .claude/config.json
```

### "No active cycle found"

Verify you have an active cycle in Linear:
```bash
linearis cycles list --team TEAM
```

Create a cycle in Linear UI or via API.
