# Catalyst Dev Plugin

Complete development workflow: research → plan → implement → validate → ship. 25 skills and 9 research agents covering the full Level 1 (single-skill) and Level 2 (guided-workflow) stack, plus Level 3 orchestration.

See the [Skills Reference](https://catalyst.coalescelabs.ai/reference/skills/) and [Agents Reference](https://catalyst.coalescelabs.ai/reference/agents/) for detailed per-skill documentation. The list below is the current inventory only.

### Shipping

- `/catalyst-dev:commit` — Conventional commits with Linear integration
- `/catalyst-dev:create-pr` — Full PR creation: commit, rebase, push, description, Linear update
- `/catalyst-dev:describe-pr` — Generate or incrementally update PR descriptions

### CI / Automation (non-interactive)

## Agents (9)

### Research

- `@catalyst-dev:codebase-locator` — Find files and directories (Haiku)
- `@catalyst-dev:codebase-analyzer` — Understand implementation details (Sonnet)
- `@catalyst-dev:codebase-pattern-finder` — Find reusable patterns and examples (Sonnet)
- `@catalyst-dev:thoughts-locator` — Search thoughts repository (Haiku)
- `@catalyst-dev:thoughts-analyzer` — Analyze documentation and decisions (Sonnet)
- `@catalyst-dev:external-research` — Research external repos and libraries (Sonnet)

### Infrastructure

- `@catalyst-dev:linear-research` — Gather Linear data via CLI (Haiku)
- `@catalyst-dev:github-research` — Research GitHub PRs and issues (Haiku)
- `@catalyst-dev:sentry-research` — Research Sentry errors (Haiku)

## Automatic Workflow Context Tracking

The plugin ships Claude Code hooks that keep `.catalyst/.workflow-context.json` up to date automatically. See [HOOKS.md](./HOOKS.md) and [WORKFLOW_CONTEXT.md](./WORKFLOW_CONTEXT.md) for the full mechanism.

Summary:

- Writes to `thoughts/shared/{research,plans,handoffs,prs}/*.md` are tracked
- Ticket IDs are extracted from filenames and directories
- Plan Mode hooks inject Catalyst's plan-structure guidance and sync plans to thoughts
- Skills read workflow context to discover prior artifacts without explicit paths

## Installation

```bash
/plugin marketplace add coalesce-labs/catalyst
/plugin install catalyst-dev
```

## Configuration

Reads `.catalyst/config.json` (safe to commit) and `~/.config/catalyst/config-{projectKey}.json` (never committed — secrets). See the [Configuration Reference](https://catalyst.coalescelabs.ai/reference/configuration/) for the full schema.

Quick setup:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coalesce-labs/catalyst/main/setup-catalyst.sh | bash
```

## Requirements

- **Required**: Git, Bash
- **Recommended**: HumanLayer CLI (`pip install humanlayer`) for the thoughts system and context-isolated worker launches
- **Optional**: Linearis CLI (`npm install -g linearis`) for Linear integration
- **Optional**: GitHub CLI (`brew install gh`) for PR workflows

## Scripts

Runtime utilities under `scripts/`:

- `catalyst-state.sh` — Writes to `~/catalyst/state.json` and `~/catalyst/events.jsonl`
- `check-prerequisites.sh` — Validate tool availability
- `check-project-setup.sh` — Validate workspace has thoughts system, config, etc.
- `create-worktree.sh` — Worktree creation with setup hooks
- `frontmatter-utils.sh` — Parse and update markdown frontmatter
- `orch-monitor/` — Web + terminal dashboard (Bun server, see [Observability](https://catalyst.coalescelabs.ai/observability/))
- `orchestrate-verify.sh` — Adversarial verification checks (test existence, reward-hacking patterns)
- `resolve-ticket.sh` — Extract ticket IDs from various contexts
- `workflow-context.sh` — Read/write `.catalyst/.workflow-context.json`

Hooks under `hooks/`:

- `update-workflow-context.sh` — PostToolUse hook that tracks thoughts writes
- `sync-plan-to-thoughts.sh` — Plan mode exit hook
- `inject-plan-template.sh` — Plan mode enter hook

## Philosophy

1. **Agents are documentarians** — Report what exists, don't critique
2. **Skills orchestrate** — Spawn parallel agents, manage processes
3. **Context is precious** — Use thoughts system for persistence between sessions
4. **Automation via hooks** — Track automatically, not manually
5. **Worker-side work has a boundary** — Workers exit at PR creation; polling-until-merged is the orchestrator's job
