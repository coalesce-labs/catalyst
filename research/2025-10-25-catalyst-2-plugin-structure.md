# Catalyst: 2-Plugin Structure

## Final Aligned Structure

### Plugin 1: **catalyst-dev** ⭐

**Everything a developer needs from understanding to shipping**

**What it contains**:

**Agents (6)** - Research is first step of dev:
- codebase-locator
- codebase-analyzer
- codebase-pattern-finder
- thoughts-locator
- thoughts-analyzer
- external-research

**Commands (15)** - Complete dev workflow:
- `/research-codebase` - Understand code (uses agents)
- `/create-plan` - Plan the solution
- `/implement-plan` - Build it
- `/validate-plan` - Verify it works
- `/commit` - Smart commits
- `/describe-pr` - PR descriptions
- `/debug` - Investigate issues
- `/create-handoff` - Pause work (clear context)
- `/resume-handoff` - Resume work (restore context)
- `/linear` - Ticket management
- `/linear-setup-workflow` - Configure Linear
- `/create-pr` - Create PR + Linear integration
- `/merge-pr` - Merge PR + Linear completion
- `/create-worktree` - Parallel work
- `/workflow-help` - Interactive guidance

**Scripts (3)**:
- `check-prerequisites.sh` - Verify HumanLayer, jq, thoughts
- `create-worktree.sh` - Worktree creation
- `frontmatter-utils.sh` - YAML utilities

**Prerequisites**:
- Required: HumanLayer CLI, jq, thoughts system
- Optional: Linear MCP

**Value**: "Research → Plan → Implement → Validate → Ship with Linear automation"

---

### Plugin 2: **catalyst-meta**

**Learn from the community and create workflows**

**What it contains**:

**Commands (5)**:
- `/discover-workflows` - Research external repos
- `/import-workflow` - Import and adapt
- `/create-workflow` - Create new workflows
- `/validate-frontmatter` - Validate consistency
- `/workflow-help` - Guidance (duplicate from dev)

**Scripts (1)**:

## Why This Makes Sense

### catalyst-dev: The Complete Dev Workflow

**Research starts dev work**:
- You research to implement a feature
- You research to fix a bug
- You research to answer a question
- Research is phase 1 of development, not a separate activity

**Handoff manages context**:
- Handoff is when you need to clear context mid-workflow
- It's a dev tool for managing Claude's context limits
- Resume brings you back to where you left off
- It's part of the flow, not separate from it

**Everything flows together**:
```
Research → Plan → Implement → Validate → Commit → PR → Merge
         ↓ (context full)
    Handoff
         ↓ (resume)
    Continue workflow
```

---

### catalyst-meta: Learning and Creating

**For inspiration and extension**:
- Learn how other teams structure workflows
- Discover best practices
- Create your own commands/agents
- Not part of daily dev work

**Publicly available** - anyone can learn and create

---

## Installation

### Most users (developers):
```bash
/plugin marketplace add coalesce-labs/catalyst
/plugin install catalyst-dev@catalyst

# One-time setup:
brew install humanlayer/tap/humanlayer jq
humanlayer thoughts init
```

**Gets**: Everything for dev workflow

---

### Power users (learning/creating):
```bash
/plugin install catalyst-dev@catalyst
/plugin install catalyst-meta@catalyst
```

**Gets**: Dev workflow + discovery/creation tools

---

## Summary

**2 Plugins**:
1. **catalyst-dev** (6 agents, 15 commands, 3 scripts) - Complete dev workflow
2. **catalyst-meta** (5 commands, 1 script) - Workflow inspiration

**Key insights**:
- Research is the first step of dev, not separate
- Handoff is for managing context during dev, not separate
- Linear integration is part of dev workflow
- Worktrees are for dev (parallel work), not PM
- Meta is for learning/creating, not daily dev

**Ready for**: `/create-plan` to implement this structure! 🚀

## No More Changes

This is it - the final aligned structure. Let's move to planning!
