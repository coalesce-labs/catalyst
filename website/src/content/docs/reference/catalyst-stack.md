  order: 10
---

`catalyst-stack` is the canonical command for bringing the Catalyst service stack up and down. It starts the four services in dependency order and is idempotent — already-running services are left alone.

## Dependency order

| Start order | Stop order |
|-------------|------------|
| mitmproxy (opt-in, `--proxy` only) | execution-core |
| broker | monitor |
| monitor | broker |
| execution-core | mitmproxy |

## Subcommands

| Subcommand | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `start` | Start all services (idempotent). |
| `stop` | Stop all services in reverse order. |
| `restart` | Stop then start. Accepts the same flags as `start`. |
| `status` | Print running/stopped state for each service. |

## Flags

### `--proxy`

Opt-in to Linear traffic capture via mitmproxy. When passed, `catalyst-stack` will:

1. Verify `mitmdump` is installed (offer `brew install mitmproxy` if absent).
2. Generate the mitmproxy CA cert at `~/.mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem` if missing.
3. Copy the vendored addon to `~/catalyst/mitm_linear_addon.py` if absent.
4. Start mitmproxy, then set `HTTPS_PROXY` / `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY` / `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` for the execution-core daemon.

Traffic is logged to `~/catalyst/linear-proxy.jsonl` (one JSON record per Linear API response, including rate-limit headers and caller attribution).

Proxy is **off by default**. The daemon runs correctly without it — you only need `--proxy` when you want Linear traffic logging.

### `--no-proxy`

Accepted for backward compatibility; no-op (proxy is already off by default).

### `--hotpatch`

Apply a post-merge update in one command: ff-pull `main`, rsync `plugins/dev/` into the resolved plugin-cache version directory, then start/restart.

```bash
# After merging or pulling new code:
catalyst-stack restart --hotpatch
```

Behavior:
- Requires `CATALYST_REPO_DIR` to point at the catalyst repo checkout, or defaults to `~/code-repos/github/coalesce-labs/catalyst`.
- Uses `git pull --ff-only origin main` — aborts on non-fast-forward merges (resolve manually, then retry).
- Rsyncs with `-ac --exclude=node_modules --exclude=.orphaned_at`. **Never uses `--delete`** — that would wipe `node_modules`.
- `start --hotpatch` refuses if the stack is already running. Use `restart --hotpatch` instead.

### `--yes`

Non-interactive mode under `--proxy`: auto-approves `brew install mitmproxy` instead of prompting.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `CATALYST_REPO_DIR` | `~/code-repos/github/coalesce-labs/catalyst` | Repo root used by `--hotpatch`. |
| `MITM_LOG` | `~/catalyst/linear-proxy.jsonl` | JSONL capture path read by the mitmproxy addon (`mitm_linear_addon.py`) — not the process log. The mitmdump process log is fixed at `~/catalyst/mitm.log` and cannot be overridden. |

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Success. |
| `1` | Error (unknown argument, proxy preflight failed, non-ff pull, etc.). |

## Examples

```bash
# Start the stack (proxy off by default)
catalyst-stack start

# Start with Linear traffic logging
catalyst-stack start --proxy

# Check what's running
catalyst-stack status

# Stop everything
catalyst-stack stop

# Restart after pulling new code
catalyst-stack restart --hotpatch

# Restart with proxy enabled
catalyst-stack restart --proxy
```
