# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this
repository.

## What This Repository Is

This is a **portable collection of Claude Code agents, commands, and workflows** for AI-assisted
development distributed as plugins. It's both:

1. A **source repository** for plugin-based agents and commands
2. A **working installation** that uses its own tools (dogfooding)

The workspace uses a plugin-based architecture where agents and commands are organized in
`plugins/dev/` and `plugins/meta/`, and installed locally via `.claude/` symlinks.

## Key Architecture Concepts

### Three-Layer System

1. **Plugin Source** (`plugins/dev/`, `plugins/meta/`)
   - Canonical definitions of agents and commands
   - Edit these when making changes
   - Organized by plugin type (dev for workflows, meta for creation)

2. **Installation Layer** (`.claude/`)
   - Symlinks to local plugin directories
   - Configuration file (`config.json`)
   - Claude Code reads plugins from here

3. **Thoughts System** (external, `~/thoughts/`)
   - Git-backed context management
   - Shared across all worktrees
   - Initialized per-project via `init-project.sh`

### Workflow State Management

Commands track workflow state via `.claude/.workflow-context.json`:

**Purpose**: Enable workflow commands to auto-discover recent documents without manual paths.

**How it works**:

- `/research-codebase` saves research → `/create-plan` auto-references it
- `/create-plan` saves plan → `/implement-plan` auto-finds it
- `/create-handoff` saves handoff → `/resume-handoff` auto-finds it

**Structure**:

```json
{
  "lastUpdated": "2025-10-26T10:30:00Z",
  "currentTicket": "PROJ-123",
  "mostRecentDocument": {
    "type": "plans",
    "path": "thoughts/shared/plans/2025-10-26-PROJ-123-feature.md",
    "created": "2025-10-26T10:30:00Z",
    "ticket": "PROJ-123"
  },
  "workflow": {
    "research": [...],  // Recent research documents
    "plans": [...],     // Recent plans
    "handoffs": [...],  // Recent handoffs
    "prs": [...]        // Recent PR descriptions
  }
}
```

**Key benefit**: Users don't need to remember or specify file paths. Commands chain together
automatically.

**Management**: Automatically updated by workflow commands. Tracked per-worktree (not committed to
git).

### Three-Layer Memory System

Catalyst uses a three-layer memory architecture to manage context across multiple projects:

**1. Project Configuration** (`.claude/config.json`)

- Contains project-specific settings (ticket prefix, Linear team, etc.)
- HumanLayer automatically maps working directories to profiles via `repoMappings`
- No manual `configName` needed - HumanLayer handles profile selection

**2. Long-term Memory** (HumanLayer thoughts repository)

- Git-backed persistent storage shared across worktrees
- Contains: `shared/research/`, `shared/plans/`, `shared/prs/`, `shared/handoffs/`
- Synced via `humanlayer thoughts sync`
- Survives across sessions and team members

**3. Short-term Memory** (`.claude/.workflow-context.json`)

- Local to each worktree (not committed to git)
- Contains pointers to recent documents in long-term memory
- Enables command chaining (e.g., `/create-plan` auto-finds recent research)
- Refreshed each session

**How They Work Together:**

│  }                                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why This Matters:**

This architecture enables you to:

- Work on multiple separate projects (work/personal, unrelated clients)
- Keep project contexts isolated via different HumanLayer configs
- Share long-term knowledge across worktrees within a project
- Chain commands together without remembering file paths
- Avoid committing secrets or session state to git

**Example Flow:**

1. HumanLayer auto-detects project's thoughts repo via repoMappings
2. `/research-codebase` saves to `~/thoughts/repos/acme/shared/research/`
3. Workflow-context tracks this as `mostRecentDocument`
4. `/create-plan` auto-references the research (no manual path needed)
5. Plan saves to `~/thoughts/repos/acme/shared/plans/`
6. Workflow-context updates to point to the new plan
7. `/implement-plan` auto-finds the plan

All while keeping different projects completely isolated.

### Agent Philosophy

All agents follow a **documentarian, not critic** approach:

- Document what EXISTS, not what should exist
- NO suggestions for improvements unless explicitly asked
- NO root cause analysis unless explicitly asked
- NO architecture critiques or quality assessments
- Focus on answering "WHERE is X?" and "HOW does X work?"

This is critical - agents are for understanding codebases, not evaluating them.

### Agent Teams vs Subagents

Claude Code provides two parallelization mechanisms. Use the right one for each task:

**Subagents (Task tool)** — Current default for most commands:
- Own context window; results return to caller
- Cannot spawn other subagents (no nesting)
- Lower token cost
- Best for: parallel research gathering, code analysis, file search

**Agent Teams (TeammateTool)** — For complex multi-domain work:
- Each teammate is a full Claude Code session
- Teammates CAN spawn their own subagents (two-level parallelism)
- Direct peer-to-peer messaging
- Higher token cost
- Best for: cross-layer features, complex implementations, competing-hypothesis debugging
- Requires `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`

**Decision framework:**

| Scenario | Use Subagents | Use Agent Teams |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Parallel research gathering | YES | Overkill |
| Code analysis / file search | YES | Overkill |
| Complex multi-file implementation | NO (can't nest) | YES |
| Cross-layer features (frontend + backend + tests) | NO | YES |
| Cost-sensitive operations | YES | NO |

**Commands that support agent teams:**
- `/implement-plan --team` — Spawns teammates for parallel phase implementation
- `/oneshot --team` — Uses agent teams in implementation phase

**Best practices:**
- Lead on Opus, teammates on Sonnet
- Size tasks at 5-6 per teammate
- Each teammate owns distinct files (prevent conflicts)
- Use plan approval gates for risky work

### Command Organization

Commands are organized into namespaces for clarity and discoverability:

- **workflow/** - Core research/plan/implement/validate flow
- **dev/** - Development workflow (commit, PR descriptions)
- **ci/** - CI/automation commands (non-interactive)
- **linear/** - Linear ticket management and PR lifecycle
- **project/** - Project-level operations (worktrees, updates)
- **handoff/** - Context persistence across sessions
- **meta/** - Workflow discovery, creation, validation

All commands:

- Orchestrate multi-step processes via sub-agents
- Use the thoughts system for persistent context
- Are configuration-driven (see `.claude/config.json`)
- Spawn parallel sub-agents for efficiency

## Common Development Tasks

### Building and Testing

This workspace has no build process - it's markdown files and bash scripts.

**Testing changes:**

1. Edit source files in `agents/` or `commands/`
2. Changes are immediately available (same repo)
3. Restart Claude Code to reload
4. Test by invoking the agent/command

### Distribution and Installation

**Catalyst is distributed as a Claude Code plugin:**

```bash
# Add to marketplace
/plugin marketplace add coalesce-labs/catalyst

# Install development workflow plugin
/plugin install catalyst-dev

# Optional: Install meta/workflow creation plugin
/plugin install catalyst-meta
```

**For development on Catalyst itself:**

This repository is both the source and a working installation (dogfooding).

**Plugin Installation (Dogfooding)**:

```bash
# The workspace has symlinks in .claude/plugins/ pointing to the plugin source
ls -la .claude/plugins/
# dev -> ../../plugins/dev
# meta -> ../../plugins/meta
```

This means:

- ✅ Changes to `plugins/dev/` or `plugins/meta/` are immediately available
- ✅ No hardcoded commands/agents in `.claude/` - uses plugin system like users do
- ✅ Restart Claude Code to reload after editing plugins
- ✅ True dogfooding - we use Catalyst exactly as users do

### Configuration System

Catalyst uses a **two-layer config system** to keep secrets out of git:

**Layer 1: Project Config** (`.claude/config.json` - safe to commit):
```json
{
  "projectKey": "acme",
  "project": {
    "ticketPrefix": "ACME",
    "name": "Acme Corp Project"
  },
  "linear": {
    "teamKey": "ACME",
    "stateMap": {
      "backlog": "Backlog",
      "todo": "Todo",
      "research": "In Progress",
      "planning": "In Progress",
      "inProgress": "In Progress",
      "inReview": "In Review",
      "done": "Done",
      "canceled": "Canceled"
    }
  },
  "thoughts": {
    "user": null
  }
}
```

**Layer 2: Secrets Config** (`~/.config/catalyst/config-{projectKey}.json` - NEVER committed):
```json
{
  "linear": {
    "apiToken": "lin_api_...",
    "teamKey": "ACME",
    "defaultTeam": "ACME"
  },
  "sentry": {
    "org": "acme-corp",
    "project": "acme-web",
    "authToken": "sntrys_..."
  },
  "railway": {
    "token": "...",
    "projectId": "..."
  },
  "posthog": {
    "apiKey": "...",
    "projectId": "..."
  },
  "exa": {
    "apiKey": "..."
  }
}
```

**Setup**:
```bash
./scripts/setup-catalyst-config.sh
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Secrets never in git
- ✅ Consistent project key across HumanLayer and Catalyst
- ✅ Multiple projects per machine (work/personal/clients)
- ✅ `.claude/config.json` only has non-sensitive metadata

**Switching projects**: Just update `projectKey` in `.claude/config.json`

Commands read config to customize behavior per-project.

### Thoughts System (REQUIRED)

Catalyst **requires** the thoughts system for all workflow commands. This provides:

- 📁 **Persistent context**: Research, plans, handoffs survive across sessions
- 🔄 **Team collaboration**: Git-backed, synced via HumanLayer
- 🌲 **Worktree sharing**: Same context across multiple feature branches

**Required Structure:**

```
thoughts/shared/
├── research/       # Research documents from /research-codebase
├── plans/          # Implementation plans from /create-plan
├── handoffs/       # Session handoffs from /create-handoff
├── prs/            # PR descriptions from /describe-pr
└── reports/        # PM reports (cycles, milestones, daily)
    ├── cycles/
    ├── milestones/
    ├── daily/
    ├── backlog/
    └── pr-sync/
```

**Setup:**

```bash
# Initialize thoughts system for your project
./scripts/humanlayer/init-project.sh . acme-corp

# Sync thoughts
humanlayer thoughts sync
```

**Validation:**

Commands automatically validate thoughts system is configured. If not, you'll see:

```
❌ ERROR: Thoughts system not configured
Run: ./scripts/humanlayer/init-project.sh . {project-name}
```

**Why Required?**

Unlike optional fallbacks, Catalyst requires thoughts because:
1. Workflow commands chain together (research → plan → implement)
2. Commands auto-find recent documents via workflow context
3. Team members need shared context
4. Worktrees need shared memory

Without thoughts, the workflow breaks.

See `docs/THOUGHTS_SETUP.md` for comprehensive setup guide.

## Core Workflows

### Research → Plan → Implement → Validate

**1. Research Phase:**

```
/research-codebase
> "How does authentication work in the API?"
```

- Spawns parallel sub-agents (locator, analyzer, pattern-finder)
- Documents what exists with file:line references
- Saves to `thoughts/shared/research/YYYY-MM-DD-description.md`

**2. Planning Phase:**

```
/create-plan
> Reference: thoughts/shared/research/2025-01-08-auth.md
> Task: Add OAuth support
```

- Reads research documents fully
- Interactive planning with user
- Includes automated AND manual success criteria
- Saves to `thoughts/shared/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-PROJ-XXX-description.md`

**2b. Iteration Phase (if revisions needed):**

```
/iterate-plan
> Feedback: Simplify the OAuth token refresh logic
```

- `/create-plan` → `/iterate-plan` (if revisions needed) → `/implement-plan`
- Revises an existing plan based on feedback
- Preserves plan structure and success criteria

**3. Implementation Phase:**

```
/implement-plan thoughts/shared/plans/2025-01-08-PROJ-123-oauth.md
```

- Reads full plan (no partial reads)
- Implements each phase sequentially
- Runs automated verification
- Updates checkboxes as work completes

**4. Validation Phase:**

```
/validate-plan
```

- Verifies all phases completed
- Runs automated test suites
- Documents deviations
- Provides manual testing steps

### Worktree Development

Create isolated workspace for parallel work:

```bash
/create-worktree PROJ-123 feature-name
```

This creates:

- Git worktree at `~/wt/{repo-name}/feature-name/`
- New branch `PROJ-123-feature-name`
- `.claude/` copied over
- `thoughts/` automatically shared (symlinked)
- Dependencies installed

**Key benefit:** Multiple features in progress, shared context via thoughts.

### Oneshot (End-to-End)

Run the full pipeline with context isolation between phases:

```
/oneshot PROJ-123
```

Chains: research → (new session) → plan → (new session) → implement

### Workflow Discovery

Discover and import workflows from external repos:

```
/discover-workflows
> Research Claude Code repositories for workflow patterns

/import-workflow
> Import workflow from repository X and adapt it

/create-workflow
> Create new agent/command based on discovered patterns
```

## Important Files to Read

When understanding the system:

1. **README.md** - High-level overview and philosophy
2. **docs/USAGE.md** - Comprehensive usage guide with examples
3. **docs/CONFIGURATION.md** - How config system works
4. **docs/AGENTIC_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md** - Agent patterns and best practices
5. **plugins/dev/agents/codebase-locator.md** - Example of agent structure
6. **plugins/dev/commands/create_plan.md** - Example of command structure

## Frontmatter Standard

All agents and commands use YAML frontmatter:

**Agents:**

```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: What this agent does
tools: Grep, Glob, Read
model: inherit
---
```

**Commands:**

```yaml
---
description: What this command does
category: workflow|utility
tools: Read, Write, Task, TodoWrite
model: inherit
version: 1.0.0
---
```

Use `/validate-frontmatter` to check consistency.

### Model Selection Guidance

Catalyst uses a three-tier model strategy:

**Tier 1: Opus** — Planning, complex analysis, implementation orchestration:
- create_plan, implement_plan, research_codebase, validate_plan, oneshot, cycle_plan, cycle_review

**Tier 2: Sonnet** — Analysis agents, PR/commit workflows, structured research:
- codebase-analyzer, external-research, describe_pr, commit, create_pr, create_handoff, linear

**Tier 3: Haiku** — Fast lookups, data collection, file finding:
- codebase-locator, thoughts-locator, linear-research, github-research

All agents and commands specify their tier explicitly in frontmatter — no more `model: inherit`.

## Dependencies

**Required:**

- Claude Code (claude.ai/code)
- Git
- Bash

**Optional:**

- HumanLayer CLI (`humanlayer`) - For thoughts system
- Linear CLI (`linear`) - For Linear integration
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) - For PR creation

**Installation:** The thoughts system requires HumanLayer CLI. Setup with:

```bash
./scripts/setup-thoughts.sh
```

## Update Strategy

**When improving Catalyst:**

1. Edit plugin files in `plugins/dev/` or `plugins/meta/`
2. Test locally (symlinks make changes immediately available)
3. Commit to workspace
4. Publish plugin updates to marketplace
5. Users update with `/plugin update catalyst-dev`

**Plugin Distribution:**

- Agents and commands are bundled in `plugins/dev/` and `plugins/meta/`
- Users get updates via Claude Code plugin system
- Local config (`.claude/config.json`) is never overwritten
- Project-specific customizations are preserved

## Integration Points

### Linear Integration

- `/linear` command for ticket management
- State transitions are configurable via `linear.stateMap` in `.claude/config.json`
- Defaults match standard Linear states (Backlog, Todo, In Progress, In Review, Done, Canceled)
- Set any `stateMap` key to `null` to skip that transition
- See `docs/LINEAR_WORKFLOW_AUTOMATION.md`

### PM Plugin (catalyst-pm)

For project management workflows with Linear:

- `/pm:analyze-cycle` - Cycle health report
- `/pm:analyze-milestone` - Milestone progress and target date assessment
- `/pm:report-daily` - Quick daily standup summary
- `/pm:groom-backlog` - Backlog analysis
- `/pm:sync-prs` - GitHub-Linear correlation

**Features**:
- Cycle management with health scoring
- Project milestone tracking toward target dates
- Backlog grooming and cleanup
- GitHub-Linear PR sync

**Setup**: Install with `/plugin install catalyst-pm`
**Docs**: See `plugins/pm/README.md`
**Architecture**: Research-first (Haiku for data collection, Opus for analysis)
**Philosophy**: All reports provide actionable insights, not just data dumps

### DeepWiki Integration

- External research via `external-research` agent
- Queries GitHub repositories for patterns
- See `docs/DEEPWIKI_INTEGRATION.md`

### HumanLayer Integration

- Thoughts system via `humanlayer` CLI
- Personal/shared/global directories
- Git-backed persistence
- Commands: `humanlayer thoughts sync`, `humanlayer thoughts status`

## Architecture Decision Records

Brief records of key architectural decisions made in this project.

### ADR-001: Plugin-Based Distribution

**Decision**: Distribute Catalyst as Claude Code plugins instead of git clone/install.

**Rationale**:

- Users get updates via `/plugin update catalyst-dev`
- No manual git pulls or symlink setup
- Plugin marketplace provides discoverability
- Local customizations (`.claude/config.json`) are preserved

**Consequences**:

- Plugin structure must be maintained in `plugins/dev/` and `plugins/meta/`
- Breaking changes require version management
- Users can install only what they need (dev vs meta plugins)

---

### ADR-002: HumanLayer Profile-Based Configuration

**Decision**: Use HumanLayer's native profile and repoMappings system for automatic thoughts repository selection.

**Rationale**:

- Users work on multiple separate projects (work/personal, different clients)
- Each project needs its own thoughts repository
- HumanLayer now supports `repoMappings` that automatically map working directories to profiles
- No manual `configName` tracking needed - HumanLayer handles profile selection

**Consequences**:

- Use `humanlayer thoughts init --profile <name>` to initialize projects
- HumanLayer automatically detects correct profile based on working directory
- Scripts use `humanlayer thoughts status` to discover current thoughts repo
- Projects remain isolated with separate long-term memory

---

### ADR-003: Three-Layer Memory Architecture

**Decision**: Separate project configuration, long-term memory (thoughts), and short-term memory
(workflow-context).

**Rationale**:

- Config: Project-specific settings, portable, committable
- Long-term: Git-backed persistence, team collaboration, survives sessions
- Short-term: Session state, command chaining, not committed

**Consequences**:

- Commands must update workflow-context.json when creating documents
- Thoughts must be synced via `humanlayer thoughts sync`
- Workflow-context must be in `.gitignore`
- System supports multiple projects and worktrees seamlessly

---

### ADR-004: Workflow-Context for Session State

**Decision**: Store recent document references in `.claude/.workflow-context.json` for command
chaining.

**Rationale**:

- Users shouldn't remember file paths between commands
- `/research-codebase` → `/create-plan` → `/implement-plan` should flow naturally
- Context must be local to each worktree
- Must not contain secrets or be committed to git

**Consequences**:

- All workflow commands must update workflow-context.json
- Helper script `scripts/workflow-context.sh` provides consistent interface
- Context is lost when worktree is deleted (by design)
- Commands can auto-discover recent documents without user input

---

### ADR-005: Configurable Worktree Convention

**Decision**: Use `GITHUB_SOURCE_ROOT` environment variable to organize repositories and worktrees
by org/repo.

**Rationale**:

- Developers have different preferences for where code lives
- Hardcoded paths (`~/Source`, `~/wt`) don't work for everyone
- Main branches and worktrees should be organized together
- Clear separation between main checkout and feature branches

**Convention**:

- Main repository: `${GITHUB_SOURCE_ROOT}/<org>/<repo>`
- Worktrees: `${GITHUB_SOURCE_ROOT}/<org>/<repo>-worktrees/<feature>`

**Consequences**:

- `create-worktree.sh` detects GitHub org from git remote
- Falls back to `~/wt/<repo>` if `GITHUB_SOURCE_ROOT` not set
- No hardcoded paths in scripts or documentation
- Clean organization by org and repo
- Easy cleanup: delete `<repo>-worktrees` directory when done

**Example**:

```
~/code-repos/github/
├── coalesce-labs/catalyst/          # Main branch
├── coalesce-labs/catalyst-worktrees/ # Feature branches
└── acme/api/                         # Client project
```

## Context Management Principles

Based on Anthropic's context engineering:

1. **Context is precious** - Use specialized agents, not monoliths
2. **Just-in-time loading** - Load context dynamically
3. **Sub-agent architecture** - Parallel research > sequential
4. **Structured persistence** - Save outside conversation (thoughts/)
5. **Read files fully** - No partial reads of key documents
6. **Wait for agents** - Don't proceed until research completes

See `docs/CONTEXT_ENGINEERING.md` for details.

## Common Patterns

### Spawning Parallel Agents

When researching, spawn multiple agents at once:

```
@catalyst-dev:codebase-locator find authentication files
@catalyst-dev:thoughts-locator find authentication research
@catalyst-dev:codebase-analyzer analyze auth flow
```

### Reading Files Fully

Always read key documents without limit/offset:

```
Read tool: file_path only, no limit/offset
```

### Using TodoWrite for Planning

Break down complex tasks:

```
TodoWrite:
1. Research existing implementation
2. Design new approach
3. Implement changes
4. Run tests
5. Validate against success criteria
```

### Configuration Access

Commands access config with:

```bash
CONFIG_FILE=".claude/config.json"
TICKET_PREFIX=$(jq -r '.project.ticketPrefix // "PROJ"' "$CONFIG_FILE")
```

## Testing and Validation

**Testing agents:**

1. Make changes to `plugins/dev/agents/*.md`
2. Restart Claude Code (symlinks ensure changes are visible)
3. Invoke with `@catalyst-dev:name task description`
4. Verify output matches expected behavior

**Testing commands:**

1. Make changes to `plugins/dev/commands/*.md` or `plugins/meta/commands/*.md`
2. Restart Claude Code (symlinks ensure changes are visible)
3. Invoke with `/command-name args`
4. Verify workflow executes correctly

**Plugin structure:**

- `plugins/dev/` - Core development workflow commands and research agents
- `plugins/meta/` - Workflow discovery and creation commands

**Validating frontmatter:**

```
/validate-frontmatter
```

**Testing plugin installation:**

```bash
/plugin list
# Should show catalyst-dev and optionally catalyst-meta

# Test a command
/research-codebase
```

## Deployment and Distribution

**Users install Catalyst via Claude Code marketplace:**

```bash
/plugin marketplace add coalesce-labs/catalyst
/plugin install catalyst-dev
```

**Setting up thoughts in a new project:**

```bash
cd /path/to/new-project

# Download init script
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coalesce-labs/catalyst/main/scripts/init-project.sh
chmod +x init-project.sh
./init-project.sh . project-name

# Sync thoughts
humanlayer thoughts sync
```

**Sharing with team:** Commit `thoughts/` to project repo. Team gets shared context via thoughts
system. Each team member installs the Catalyst plugin independently.

## CI/Automation Commands

Catalyst includes non-interactive commands for CI pipelines and automated workflows:

- `/catalyst-dev:ci_commit` — Create commits autonomously (no user prompts)
- `/catalyst-dev:ci_describe_pr` — Generate/update PR descriptions autonomously

These commands follow the same conventions (conventional commits, PR templates) but skip all interactive prompts. They never commit sensitive files or add Claude attribution.

## Versioning and Releases

Catalyst uses **Release Please** for automated per-plugin releases.

### How It Works

1. **Merge PRs to main** with conventional commit titles (`feat(dev):`, `fix(pm):`, etc.)
2. **Release Please opens release PRs** — one per affected plugin, accumulating changes
3. **Merge a release PR** to create: git tag, GitHub Release, updated CHANGELOG.md, bumped versions
4. **marketplace.json syncs automatically** via post-release CI step

### Version Locations

| File | Purpose | Updated By |
|---|---|---|
| `plugins/<x>/version.txt` | Release Please primary version | Release Please |
| `plugins/<x>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | Plugin manifest | Release Please (extra-files) |
| `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` | Marketplace registry | Post-release sync script |
| `plugins/<x>/CHANGELOG.md` | Per-plugin changelog | Release Please |

### Commit Conventions for Releases

- `feat(dev): add new command` → minor bump for catalyst-dev
- `fix(pm): correct cycle calculation` → patch bump for catalyst-pm
- `feat(dev)!: breaking change` → major bump for catalyst-dev
- `chore(meta): update docs` → no version bump (chore commits don't trigger releases)

### Manual Version Override

If you need to manually bump a version (rare):

```bash
./scripts/bump-version.sh dev minor  # Still works but deprecated
```

### Tag Format

Tags follow `<component>-v<version>` format: `catalyst-dev-v4.3.0`, `catalyst-pm-v4.1.0`

## Multi-Config Support

For consultants working across clients:

```bash
# Download multi-config setup
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coalesce-labs/catalyst/main/scripts/setup-multi-config.sh
chmod +x setup-multi-config.sh
./setup-multi-config.sh

# Switch between configs
hl-switch client-name
```

Manages separate configs per client. See `docs/MULTI_CONFIG_GUIDE.md`.

## Key Principles When Editing

1. **Agents are documentarians** - Never suggest improvements unless asked
2. **Commands are workflows** - Orchestrate, don't implement
3. **Config drives behavior** - No hardcoded values
4. **Read fully, not partially** - Especially tickets, plans, research
5. **Spawn parallel agents** - Maximize efficiency
6. **Wait for completion** - Don't synthesize partial results
7. **Preserve context** - Save to thoughts/, not just memory
8. **Smart updates** - Merge workspace changes, keep local config

## Getting Help

- Check `docs/` for comprehensive guides
- Review `README.md` for philosophy
- Read `QUICKSTART.md` for setup
- Use `/workflow-help` for interactive guidance
- Examine plugin source in `plugins/dev/` and `plugins/meta/`

## Version Control

This workspace tracks:

- Agent definitions
- Command workflows
- Documentation
- Scripts
- Configuration templates (generic values)

**Do NOT commit to this workspace:**

- Specific ticket prefixes (keep "PROJ")
- Linear team/project IDs (keep null)
- Personal thoughts user (keep null)

**Do commit to project repos:**

- Real config values
- Project-specific customizations
- Shared thoughts content
